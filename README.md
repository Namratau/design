# ResponsiveDesign
To make it responsive, Media Query is often the option we choose. I, on the other hand, tried a different approach, without Media Query, I tried to make it responsive. 

## Task Description:
Create cards that follow the responsive-design pattern. Sepcifically, the task require you to create 2 differen cards on the same screen:
### 1.Card 1 (The card at the top):
As the screen size grows or shrinks, the width of the card changes to occupy the same porpotion of the screen. Furthermore, the green-area inside it also grows to take the same proportion of the screen as before.

### 2. Card 2 (The card at the bottom):
Ad the screen size grows or shrinks, the width of the card changes to occupy the same poportion of the screen. Furthermore, the green-area inside it also changes. Also note that, even though the size of the card is changing, the grey-area still maintains its size and remains at the top-center of the card.
